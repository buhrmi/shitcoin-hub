# Shitcoin Hub

This project aims to become something like the wikipedia of shitcoins and an authorative source of information to protect the general public from investing into bullshit. I'm planning to add shitcoin trading functionality in the future, so don't get confused by the order matching and exchange code buried in the source.

## Synopsis

Shitcoin Hub is a website where you can submit information about shitcoins, the people who issue them, and the benefits people can enjoy for hodling them (if any). This information will be provided free of charge to others, so people can avoid buying into shilled coins.

If it's too late and you already carry bags filled with shit, Shitcoin Hub will provide a convenient way for you to trade them for other shitcoins (or maybe even fiat money).

## Why?

I've been thinking about raising funds for music festivals in Japan by issuing my own token. When researching how to effectively sell a token, I realized that almost everybody out there is resorting to the same common tactic: Finding guillable people and shill. So I'm building a place where people can submit the tokens they come across and provide accurate information about them, and help others to avoid being caught in a shill.

## Application Architecture

This is a [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) app with a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) API.
