# Shitcoin Hub

This project aims to become something like the wikipedia of shitcoins and an authorative source of information to protect the general public from investing into bullshit. I'm planning to add shitcoin trading functionality in the future, so don't get confused by the order matching and exchange code buried in the source.

## Synopsis

Shitcoin Hub is a website where you can submit information about shitcoins, the people who issue them, and the benefits people can enjoy for hodling them (if any). This information will be provided free of charge to others, so people can avoid buying into shilled coins.

If it's too late and you already carry bags filled with shit, Shitcoin Hub will provide a convenient way for you to trade them for other shitcoins (or maybe even fiat money)..

## Application Architecture

This is a [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) app with a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) API.
