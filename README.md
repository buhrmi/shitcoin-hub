# Buhrmi's Shitcoin Hub

The goal of this project is to build the wikipedia of shitcoins and to protect the general public from investing into shilled bullshit.

It is planned to add shitcoin trade in the future, so don't get confused by the order matching code hidden away in the source.

## Introduction

Buhrmi's shitcoin hub is a website where you can submit information about shitcoins, the people who issue them, and the benefits people can enjoy for hodling them (if any). We will provide all this information free of charge, so you can avoid buying into shilled coins. 

If it's too late and you already carry bags filled with shit, we are going to provide a convenient way for you to trade them for other shitcoins (or maybe even fiat money).

## Why?

I've been thinking about raising funds for music festivals in Japan by issuing my own token. When researching how to effectively sell a token, I realized that almost everybody out there is resorting to the same common tactic: Finding guillable people and shill. So I'm building a place where people can submit the tokens they come across and provide accurate information about them, and help other to avoid being caught in a shill.

## Application Architecture

This is a [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) app with a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) API.
